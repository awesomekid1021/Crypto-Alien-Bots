        <h3>
            The Alien Crypto Bots had a peaceful civilization on Planet Bot. Stable energy sources, great materials, and no one to bother them. Though they got some new visitors, the Zeta insect bots. These insect bots were part insect part killing machine and once they knew of Planet's bot's energy source, they knew they needed it. So, these insect bots at first made a treaty in order to get the Erridium and wage war on the Alien Cryptos. Soon, the insects waged a war that lasted nearly an eon before the Crypto Bots, heavily beaten, fled to Planet Earth where the insect bots couldn't track them. Most Crypto bots restarted their peaceful life in different occupations with humans, but some couldn't contain their lust for battle and revenge. They took it upon themselves to upgrade into different models and soon they merged into the cryptoverse, where they live for now on.
